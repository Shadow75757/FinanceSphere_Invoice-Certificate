The FinanceSphere project seeks to automate the renewal of software certificates based on invoice payments for billing software products sold on a pre-defined periodic basis. 

 

The FinanceSphere system is designed to verify the status of client payments, enabling senior management to either approve the renewal of software licenses seamlessly or determine if a direct discussion with the client is necessary to align mutual interests. 

 

For training purposes, this product will be developed as a simplified demo and will not include all the features of the final project. However, it may evolve throughout the training process based on the knowledge gained.
